# BiometricSequenceAligner
This application was developed for a university module, which implements a dynamic programming method for pairwise alignment of two biological sequences. The basic program performs the global alignment of two sequences using a substitution matrix, and a linear gap penalty using dynamic programming. The program displays an optimal alignment and its associated score. 

Extra features implemented:
- Affine gap penalty
- Semi global and local alignment
